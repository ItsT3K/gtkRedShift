# gtkRedShift
A very simple GTK3 Frontend for QRedShift. Written initially for Ubuntu Unity as it has no built in *night light* feature. Can be used on other distributions and other desktop environments however as long as `qredshift` is installed and present. Written in Python for portability and simplicity.
## Prerequisites
- `qredshift` **must** be installed and **must** be located at `/usr/bin`
- PyGtk3
## Usage
1. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/ItsT3K/gtkRedShift`
2. enter the directory
3. do the following to make the program executable `chmod +x grsh.py`
4. now you can execute it by either clicking on it or running `./grsh.py` from the gtkRedShift folder
